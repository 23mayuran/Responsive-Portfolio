      <p>This is my dog neo. He is half labrador retriever, half white shepherd, but 100% Doofus. Both of us go on a lot of adventures 
          in the pacific north west, from backpacking to swimming in lakes in the wilderness to visiting Dog parks around the area.
          My portfolio will mostly have pictures of our adventures and my life changing trip to Iceland this past January (Feels like its been years since that trip!)
          My trip to Icelnad was mainly to go see the Norther Lights and you will see a few pictures of nature at its full glory! 
          I would reccomend Iceland to anyone, if you would like more information about my trip please fill out the form on the <a href=contact.html>Contact Page</a>, and I'd be more than happy to help.
